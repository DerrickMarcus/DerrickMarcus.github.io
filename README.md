Welcome!

This is the personal blog of Yanxu Chen.

I'm currently an undergraduate student in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University.

In this blog I plan to share some knowledge and skills during my study in computer, focusing on some environmental settings, development tools, programming and professional softwares.
