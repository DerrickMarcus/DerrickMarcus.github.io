Welcome to my personal blog!

I'm Yanxu Chen, currently an undergraduate student in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua Uniersity

In this blog, I plan to share some college course notes, research knowledge and skills during my exploration to computer science. They may focus on some environmental settings, development tools, programming and professional softwares.

Let's begin!
