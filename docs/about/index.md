# About

I am currently an undergraduate student in Tsinghua University, majoring EE in the Department of Electronic Engineering. I'm going to be a PhD student in 2026, majoring Information and Communication Engineering.

I am interested in computer science and information system.

    I'd climb every mountain<br>
    我翻越每一座山峦<br>
    And swim every ocean<br>
    漂越每一篇海洋<br>
    Just to be with you<br>
    只为与你相伴
