# Typst

## Introduction

If you have ever used LaTeX, you must know the how hard and inconvenient to use it. It is slow to install, slow to run, and the error messages can be very confusing. Typst is here to fix that.

Typst is a new typesetting system built with **Rust**, incredibly fast. It feels as simple as writing in Markdown, but it creates professional, high-quality PDFs just like LaTeX.

## Setup

Install from the official site: [typst-app](https://typst.app/open-source/)

Validate the installation:

```bash
typst --version
```

You can also install the VS Code extension: Tinymist Typst (Myriad Dreamin). It provide these features:

- Instant Preview: It opens a panel next to your code that updates instantly as you type. No manual recompiling needed.
- Smart Autocomplete (LSP): It suggests functions, hints at parameters, and catches errors.
- Formatting: Keeps your code clean and readable automatically.
- Export to PDF file.
